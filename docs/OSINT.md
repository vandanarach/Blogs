# **What is Open Source Intelligence?**

OSINT refers to all the information that is publicly available. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) defines OSINT as follows:“Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is an intelligence that is produced from publicly available information and is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement.”

OSINT is different from other forms of intelligence in that the information may be accessed by the general public without having to break any copyright or privacy laws. This essentially means that the data is "publically available" and is meant as much for a security professional who is acquiring data for a forensic investigation, or a penetration test, or for a risk management/assessment,  as it is for a law enforcement or military personnel or a student or an academic researcher.

The unrestricted access to the Internet (the world wide web) is one reason OSINT is increasingly gaining popularity and traction among security professionals as also among common public who wish to exploit the widely available Internet resources effectively.

## **Categories of Open Information and Intelligence:**

An excerpt below from the book "Open Source Intelligence Methods and Tools: A Practical Guide to Online Intelligence by Nihad A. Hassan; Rami Hijazi" on categories of information and intelligence:

"""According to the NATO Open Source Intelligence Handbook V1.2 published in 2001, there are four categories of open information and intelligence:

**Open Source Data (OSD)**: This is generic data coming from a primary source. Examples include satellite images, telephone call data and metadata, datasets, survey data, photographs, and audio or video recordings that have recorded an event.

**Open source information (OSINF)** : This is generic data that has undergone some filtering first to meet a specific criterion or need; this data can also be called a secondary source. Examples include books about a specific subject, articles, dissertations, artworks, and interviews.

**Open source intelligence (OSINT)** : This includes all the information that has been discovered, filtered, and designated to meet a specific need or purpose. This information can be used directly in any intelligence context. OSINT can be defined in a nutshell as the output of open source material processing.

**Validated OSINT (OSINT-V)**: This is OSINT with a high degree of certainty; the data should be confirmed (verified) using a non-OSINT source or from a highly reputable OSINT source. This is essential, as some outside adversaries may spread inaccurate OSINT information with the intent to mislead OSINT analysis. A good example of this is when a TV station broadcasts live the arrival of a president to another country; such information is OSINT, but it has a large degree of certainty."""

## **OSINT Techniques:**

Collection of Open Source Intelligence techniques fall into two broad categories: **Passive** and **Active**.

**Passive**: This is the most common form of OSINT gathering. In this category the target is not knowledgeable about your intelligence gathering activities. The search is anonymously performed and there is not direct interaction between the target and the agent performing the information gathering task.

**Active**: This is the second form of OSINT collection. In this category, the end target is aware or might become aware of the OSINT gathering activity as the agent might do a port scan or banner grabbing to detect the type of operating  system the target IT infrasutructure is functioning on and in the process might send packets to the target to gather this information. The traffic being sent to the target to gather such information might leave traces on the Intrusion Prevention/Detection system.

## **Listing of some web based tools for OSINT:**

One very informative and useful OSINT framework website is give below. OSINT Framework is an open source intelligence gathering framework that helps security professionals for performing automated footprinting and reconnaissance, OSINT research, and intelligence gathering. It is focused on gathering information from free tools or resources. This framework includes a simple web interface that lists various OSINT tools arranged by category and is shown as an OSINT tree structure on the web interface.

Shodan is an OSINT search engine that can search for keywords and also allows to search based on filters. It is a search engine meant for IOT Devices.

Another such search engine for IOT devices is Censys:

Google hacking or Google Dorking is a url filtering methodology using advanced google search queries to search information about a target or locate a target. There are certain tools available that can be used to make use of Google Hacking for OSINT gathering. The below website has a google hacking database which is a collection of strings or regular expressions that can be used to gather information on  Google.

People search websites provide information about general public and accessing such information from these social networking websites can lead us to information related to a particular target. Different social networking websites provide different aspects to the life of a particular target.
 
In conclusion, there is a lot of information out there on the Internet and it is left to the discretion of the end user to make a responsible decision to use the information in a legally and ethically correct way!
